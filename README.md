This is my computer science investigatory project about a stock screener application which i completely made it on python using tkinter. 
Its got a good UI that can be used in other applications so I've made this public.

After the returning user page pls import whatever the next page you want to present, also change the name, logo, bg images and basically whatever you want in the specified files.

if you get any errors try reinstalling the modules if it persists contact me.
